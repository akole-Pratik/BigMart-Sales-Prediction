# BigMart-Sales-Prediction

# Aim of Project
The main objective is to find the sales per product for each store and evaluate meaningful insights. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand different attributes of the product and apply them to increase their overall sales.

# Problem Statement
We need to analyse the dataset and come up with more insights and our main objective is to predict the Sales figure.

# Approach
1) By applying Exploratory Data Analysis we will identify the relation between different attributes and evaluate meaningful information.

2) By applying different supervised machine learning algorithms we will predict the sales.

# Algorithms used
1) Linear Regression
2) Random Forest
3) XGBoost

Libraries used
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) Seaborn
4) sklearn

# Conclusion(Observation)
1) XGBoost Regressor and Random Forest are best performing Models, we can use both to check on test data set and find out which perform better.
2) MRP has huge correlation with the Outlet Sales.
3) The products or Items with highest/greater MRP are sold maximum.
4) Low Fat and Regular both are equally generate more revenue.
5) Although Fruits and Vegetables unit sold are high, but revenue generated by Seafood is much higher, so we have to focus more on such products.
